## Overview

### What I learned

- **Relative Positioning**: Used to position elements relative to their normal position. In the project, `.top-container` uses `position: relative`; to serve as a reference point for absolutely positioned children.
- **Absolute Positioning**: Positions elements relative to their nearest positioned ancestor. The `.overlay-container` uses `position: absolute`; to be placed within the `.top-container`.
- **Combining Positioning and Flexbox**: Combining `position: absolute`; with flexbox can create dynamic and responsive layouts. For example, the `.overlay-container` is absolutely positioned within a flexbox container.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
